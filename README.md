# Airfare Cost Analysis - Power BI Project

## Objectives

• To analyze and visualize the airfare expenses of a company in order to give insight to management about how to proceed with next year's
budget planning. 


## Scenario

A company needs to plan their airfare budget for the next year. They have data from the current year (2013) and they want to know about
the airlines, booking sources, ticket prices, purchasing times, and class level to make more informed decisions for the following year.

The management wants to see:

• Details of the employee's flight history --> how many tickets they bought, how many days in advance, which airline agency they booked
from, what seat class they prefer
• Average days employee booked in advance vs. total paid
• The percentage of total tickets purchased days in advance
• What time of the year employees travel the most

## Limitations

- There are empty cells under several categories and 346 tickets priced 0 USD which may be distorting the calculations.

## Key Findings

• On November 13th, around 28k USD was spent on one employee's Default Travel Class ticket. Further investigation is needed to
understand the reasons behind this.

• Employees traveled the most in July. The main reason was the increase in flights (84) on July 8th.

• July 8th is followed by May 5th with 28 flights.

• Other than these two dates with most flights, majority of the increases in flights happened either on Mondays or Sundays throughout the
year.

• %90 of the flight tickets were bought through Sabre Agency. It should be checked if the company receives any incentives from the
agency. A comparative analysis on different agencies and incentives could be beneficial for the company's airfare expenses.

• 27% of all tickets were from Alaska Airlines.

• 3% of the tickets were VIP with %5 share of the total ticket price.

• VIP tickets were bought with more time in advance, whereas 60% of the Default Travel Class tickets were bought with up to 2 weeks in
advance. An analysis is recommended to see what can be done in order to buy the tickets earlier.
